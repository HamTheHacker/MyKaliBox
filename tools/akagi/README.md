# Usage

Run executable from command line: akagi32 [Key] [Param] or akagi64 [Key] [Param]. See "Run examples" below for more info.

First param is number of method to use, second is optional command (executable file name including full path) to run. Second param can be empty - in this case program will execute elevated cmd.exe from system32 folder.

Note:
* Several methods require process injection, so they won't work from wow64, use x64 edition of this tool;
* Method (4) unavailable in 64 bit edition because of Shim restriction;
* Method (6) unavailable in wow64 environment starting from Windows 8.
* Method (11) implemented in x86-32 version;
* Method (13) (19) and above implemented only in x64 version.

Run examples:
* akagi32.exe 1
* akagi64.exe 3
* akagi32 1 c:\windows\system32\calc.exe
* akagi64 3 c:\windows\system32\charmap.exe

# Warning
* This tool shows ONLY popular UAC bypass method used by malware, and reimplement some of them in a different way improving original concepts. There are exists different, not yet known to general public methods, be aware of this;  
* Using (5) method will permanently turn off UAC (after reboot), make sure to do this in test environment or don't forget to re-enable UAC after tool usage;
* Using (5), (9) methods will permanently compromise security of target keys (UAC Settings key for (5) and IFEO for (9)), if you do tests on your real machine - restore keys security manually after you complete this tool usage;
* This tool is not intended for AV tests and not tested to work in aggressive AV environment, if you still plan to use it with installed bloatware AV soft - you use it at your own risk;
* Some AV may flag this tool as HackTool, MSE/WinDefender constantly marks it as malware, nope;
* If you run this program on real computer remember to remove all program leftovers after usage, for more info about files it drops to system folders see source code;
* Since 2.4 all added methods/code will be strictly x64. I don't see any sense in supporting 32 bit versions of Windows in 2016 year.

# Protection
* UAC turned on maximum level and full awareness about every window it will show;
* Account without administrative privileges.

# Malware usage
* It is currently known that UACMe used by Adware/Multiplug (9), by Win32/Dyre (3), by Win32/Empercrypt (10 & 13). We do  not take any responsibility for this tool usage in the malicious purposes. It is free, open-source and provided AS-IS for everyone.

# Other usage
* Currently used as "signature" by "THOR APT" scanner (handmade pattern matching fraudware from Germany). We do  not take any responsibility for this tool usage in the fraudware;
* In July 2016 so-called "security company" Cymmetria released report about script-kiddie malware bundle called "Patchwork" and false flagged it as APT. They stated it was using "UACME method", which in fact is just slightly and unprofessionally modified injector dll from UACMe v1.9 and was using Carberp/Pitou hybrid method in malware self-implemented way. We do not take any responsibility for UACMe usage in the dubious advertising campaigns from third party "security companies".
